# How to select and have an elective approved

For the electives there are different procedures for different types of electives:

1. Pre-approved electives
2. Courses not pre-approved

## 1. Pre-approved electives

The list of pre-approved Geomatics electives are listed there for the different quarters: <https://studyguide.tudelft.nl/opleidingen/study-guide/educations/10542>. 

Those are composed of geomatics courses (GM-codes), BK faculty courses, and courses at other faculties.

If you attend and pass one of these pre-approved elective courses, it should be automatically added to your OSIRIS. There is no other actions to take.

## 2. Courses not pre-approved

If you are interested in following a course that is not pre-approved you can ask for that course to be approved **before the course starts**. 

Formally, it needs to be approved by the Board of Examiners and the Programme Director of the MSc Geomatics.

The procedure to follow:

1. Send an email to <geomatics@tudelft.nl> explaining which course you want to follow and why you think it’s related to Geomatics.
2. Attach the filled form "Geomatics Master Electives List" to the email; the form is there: https://www.tudelft.nl/studenten/bk-studentenportal/praktische-zaken/formulieren
3. With a positive advice: send the form of step 2 to the Board of Examiners <[Examencommissie-BK@tudelft.nl](mailto:Examencommissie-BK@tudelft.nl)> and take the elective.

## Electives at other universities

**Exchange**: the faculty has an exchange programmes with a few other universities. For Geomatics we have such an arrangement with TU Munich and Aalto University. The student pays their tuition fees in Delft. The courses will have to be approved by the programme director of Geomatics and the Board of Examiners of our Faculty (see “Courses not pre-approved”). The procedures is taken care of by the international office of our Faculty. There is a limited number of students that can be admitted.

**Not part of an exchange programme**: the student takes care of all the administration. The programme director and the Board of Examiners of our Faculty approve the courses to be taken at the other university. Not all universities welcome students outside their regular program. And often students have to pay extra fees to be able to take the course. Please note that if you want to take electives at another university in the Netherlands you may have to register as a (subsidiary/ bijvakstudent) student of that university. The procedures vary per university. For UTwente here more information is provided: https://www.utwente.nl/en/education/student-services/educational-services-procedures/admission-enrolment/bijvakker-kiesopmaat/
